# ReadMe Generator

  ## Description 
  
   The ReadMe Generator project is used to allow a user to automatically generate a readme file from the command line.  The goal would be for a user to use the command line while in this directory (having cloned it to their own device and installed all the appropriate node.js programs) and answer the questions they are prompted with.  Their answers will then be formatted into the appropriate section of the ReadMe.
